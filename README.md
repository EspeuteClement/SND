# SND

Status : Extremely early prototype

#Goal

Open source and portable tracker with an interface similar to the fantastic LSDJ.

# Build

On windows x64 bit, running the Build.bat file is enough to build the whole program.

On other platform, simply include and link with SDL 2.0.10, then build everything in `src/`
